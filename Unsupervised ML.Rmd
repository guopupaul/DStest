Objective: Build a regressor that recommends the “crew” size for potential ship buyers.

1. Read the file and display columns.
```{r message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(mlr3verse)
library(readxl)
library("FactoMineR")
library("factoextra")
library("corrplot")
library(class)
library(outliers)
```

```{r}
info <- read_excel("ship info.csv",col_names = TRUE)
glimpse(info)
```
2. Calculate basic statistics of the data (count, mean, std, etc) and examine data and state your observations.
3. Select columns that will be probably important to predict “crew” size.
4. If you removed columns explain why you removed those.
5. Use one-hot encoding for categorical features.
6. Create training and testing sets (use 60% of the data for the training and reminder for testing).
7. Build a machine learning model to predict the ‘crew’ size.
8. Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient for the training set and testing data sets.
9. Describe hyper-parameters in your model and how you would change them to improve the performance of the model.
10.What is regularization? What is the regularization parameter in your model?
11.Plot regularization parameter value vs Pearson correlation for the test and training sets, and see whether your model has bias problem or variance problem.
This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
